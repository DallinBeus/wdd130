    <p>Howdy World. i'm a small town kid, who had too much time on his hands.
       I love to sculpt, dance, read, listen to audio books, and talk to cute girls! 
       I like to say lifes to short to not try everything!  
    </p>
    <p>I am doing computer science and look forwad to learning every asspect of the industry!
       I chose this degree because of my experience in a internship: I needed to set up a data base on DaVinci Reslove.
       I spent a week learning how to clear a port, create a sql data base, and learn all of this on mac... I don't do apple. 
       after this experience I liked apple a little less. 
       </p> 
       <p> I look forward to all I will learn in class about programing!!!!
        </p>
